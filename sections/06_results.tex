AIR is the minimum ratio of group-wise selection rates as defined in \cref{eq:air}, with 95\% BCa bootstrap confidence intervals, reported as lower and upper confidence limits (LCI/UCI). AIR values below the 0.80 threshold indicate a potential disparate impact under the four-fifths rule.}

\subsection{Equalised Odds}
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\input{includes/table_eo_summary}
\caption{Equalised Odds gaps (TPR and FPR differences) by protected attribute on the synthetic audit test split, with 95\% BCa bootstrap confidence intervals, reported as lower and upper confidence limits (LCI/UCI). Gaps are computed as in \cref{eq:eo-gap}, that is, as the maximum minus the minimum group-wise TPR/FPR across categories of each attribute.}
\label{tab:eo_summary}
\end{table}

\ifnum\HasDegenerateCIs>0
\noindent\emph{Note.} Some groups in this synthetic scenario have rates at 0\% or 100\%. With aggregate bootstrap this can yield zero-width confidence intervals, even though real-world uncertainty would be larger. FL-BSA compliance reports use row-level BCa bootstrap to mitigate this effect.

\subsection{Calibration}
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\input{includes/table_ece_summary}
\caption{ECE summary for this run. ECE is defined in \cref{eq:ece}. In this synthetic audit scenario, ECE is not evaluated because no probability scores are available in the intake bundle; calibration compliance is therefore unknown.}
\label{tab:ece_summary}
\end{table}

\ifnum\EceEvaluated>0\relax
% Calibration evaluated; no additional note.
\else
\noindent\emph{Note.} Calibration (ECE) was not evaluated in this scenario; calibration compliance is therefore unknown in this whitepaper.

\subsection{Provenance}
The run manifest records the dataset hash, code commit, container image digests, random seeds, and timestamps; key fields are listed in Appendix~E.
