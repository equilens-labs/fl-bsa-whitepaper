Perfect—thanks for the crisp sync. You’re on the right track and very close to a reviewer‑ready drop. I folded your notes into a concrete “from v3 → reviewer‑ready” path and added a Gate Pack to harden CI and bundling.

⸻

✅ What you’ve already locked in (from your summary)
	•	A scaffold that closes Block‑2 gaps: EO/ECE metrics with 95% CIs, provenance capture, schema enforcement, privacy evidence stubs, and CI gates.
	•	A Quickstart sequence that computes AIR/EO/ECE, captures provenance, runs acceptance checks vs SAP thresholds (AIR ≥ 0.80, EO gap ≤ 0.05, ECE ≤ 0.02), and generates traceability.
	•	Clear RACI: Platform/QA → audit scoring + provenance; QA → CI; Security → privacy tests; Compliance → regulatory matrix; MRM → draft refresh.
	•	Demo run on synthetic aggregates already yields all artifacts; real data slots right in.

🔒 New “Gate Pack” to finish the loop (drop‑in)

I prepared a repo‑ready Gate Pack that tightens acceptance, standardizes the reviewer bundle, and makes the PR process fool‑proof.
	•	Download:
	•	Gate Pack: wp_repo_gatepack_v3.zip
	•	(You already have the Scaffold): wp_resync_scaffold_v3.zip

What the Gate Pack adds:

Area	What you get	Where
Strict CI	Fails the build if thresholds or schemas aren’t met, and if container_digest is a placeholder	.github/workflows/acceptance_strict.yml
PR discipline	Reviewer‑ready PR checklist with acceptance items	.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
Bundle spec & DoD	Reviewer bundle required files + Block‑2 Definition of Done	docs/Reviewer_Bundle_Spec.md, docs/WP-DoD.md
Flexible ingestion	Metric alias map (recall→TPR, fallout→FPR, etc.)	config/metrics_aliases.yaml
Local verification	verify_reviewer_bundle.py (ensures AIR/EO/ECE with CIs, real digest/hash, privacy JSONs present)	scripts/verify_reviewer_bundle.py
One‑click zip	build_reviewer_bundle.py packages a reviewer‑ready ZIP	scripts/build_reviewer_bundle.py
Make targets	make verify and make bundle convenience targets	Makefile

🔁 How to integrate (low‑friction order)
	1.	Keep your Scaffold as‑is.
It already computes AIR/EO/ECE with CIs and captures provenance.
	2.	Merge the Gate Pack on top of it.
	•	Copy the Gate Pack files into your repo root (it won’t overwrite existing scaffold files).
	•	Keep your existing CI; add acceptance_strict.yml to enforce “no placeholders” for container digests and require privacy evidence files.
	3.	Wire the PR flow.
	•	Every PR now shows the acceptance checklist.
	•	CI will fail if any of: AIR < 0.80, TPR/FPR gaps > 0.05, ECE > 0.02, schema missing CIs/n, container_digest is placeholder, or privacy evidence JSONs are absent.
	4.	Before you push real metrics:
	•	Run locally:

make verify
make bundle

This will validate and produce a reviewer‑ready ZIP.

🧭 What “reviewer‑ready” means (Block‑2 DoD)
	•	metrics_long.csv has AIR, tpr_gap, fpr_gap, ece (all with 95% CIs), and per‑group selection_rate, tpr, fpr (with Wilson CIs).
	•	provenance/manifest.json has non‑placeholder container_digest and a dataset SHA‑256 hash; seed recorded.
	•	privacy/tests/*.json present (membership, attribute inference, DP accounting if applicable).
	•	regulatory_matrix.csv refreshed (no “TBD” for in‑scope items).
	•	CI green on acceptance_strict.yml.
	•	Traceability regenerated and referenced in the draft.

(These are pre‑written in docs/WP-DoD.md for your repo.)

📦 Reviewer bundle spec (what the ZIP must contain)

Required files (and the Gate Pack will verify this):
	•	metrics_long.csv — contains: AIR, tpr_gap, fpr_gap, ece (+ CIs, n), and per‑group selection_rate, tpr, fpr (+ CIs, n).
	•	provenance/manifest.json — non‑placeholder container_digest, dataset_hash, code_commit, rng_seed, timestamps.
	•	regulatory_matrix.csv — mapped to controls & evidence.
	•	privacy/tests/privacy_evidence_{membership,attribute}.json, privacy/tests/dp_accounting.json.
	•	config/sap.yaml.

(Full details in docs/Reviewer_Bundle_Spec.md.)

⸻

🛡 Guardrails & common pitfalls (fix now, avoid rework)
	•	Run IDs must be stable across drops. Use RUN_ID env var when running compute_metrics.py.
	•	Group labels: use attr:value consistently (and prefer fixed dictionaries for attr/value).
	•	Container digest: provide an actual repo@sha256:… (the strict CI fails on “not_available”).
	•	Bootstrap settings: leave B=2000, α=0.05 unless your SAP says otherwise; record them in the manifest.
	•	Calibration: ensure ECE is computed with the same binning across runs; log bin edges to avoid “moving bins.”

🧰 Commands you’ll actually run

# 1) Compute AIR/EO/ECE with 95% CIs from aggregates
python3 scripts/compute_metrics.py --inputs example_inputs --sap config/sap.yaml --out metrics_long.csv

# 2) Capture provenance (digest/hash/seed/timestamps)
bash provenance/capture_provenance.sh

# 3) Enforce acceptance + schemas locally (fail-fast)
python3 scripts/check_acceptance.py --metrics metrics_long.csv --manifests provenance/manifest.json --sap config/sap.yaml

# 4) Verify reviewer bundle completeness (privacy evidence + regulatory + thresholds)
python3 scripts/verify_reviewer_bundle.py \
  --metrics metrics_long.csv \
  --manifest provenance/manifest.json \
  --regulatory regulatory_matrix.csv \
  --privacy privacy/tests \
  --sap config/sap.yaml

# 5) Build the reviewer ZIP for distribution
python3 scripts/build_reviewer_bundle.py --out-dir out

Or just:

make verify
make bundle

🗺 Suggested next PRs (small, merge‑able units)
	1.	Metrics Layer PR — adds EO/ECE with CIs to metrics_long.csv (real data), stable RUN_ID.
	2.	Provenance PR — populates real container_digest and dataset hash.
	3.	Privacy PR — drops JSON evidence from your actual tests (replace stubs).
	4.	Compliance PR — refresh regulatory_matrix.csv and regenerate traceability.
	5.	Draft Refresh PR — pulls new tables into the whitepaper and updates the exec summary claims.

Each PR will be checked by the strict CI and the PR checklist, so you can merge confidently.
