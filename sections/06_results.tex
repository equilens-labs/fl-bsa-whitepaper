\caption{Disparity ratios (AIR-equivalent) by protected attribute on the synthetic audit test split. For gender we report the configured pair (\GenderProtectedGroup{} vs \GenderReferenceGroup{}). Race is shown in the main body only when the race small-n display policy is satisfied; otherwise it is reported in the annex. Intervals are deterministic (delta-method on $\log(\mathrm{AIR})$), and p-values are two-sided with small-n safeguards.}

\subsection{Approval-Rate Gaps}
\begin{table}[t]

\input{includes/table_srg_summary}
\caption{Approval-rate gaps (SRG) by protected attribute on the synthetic audit test split. SRG is defined in \cref{eq:srg} as the protected group selection rate minus the reference group selection rate, with deterministic confidence intervals and two-sided p-values.}

\subsection{Calibration}
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\input{includes/table_ece_summary}
\caption{ECE summary for this run. ECE is defined in \cref{eq:ece}. In this synthetic audit scenario, ECE is not evaluated because no probability scores are available in the intake bundle; calibration compliance is therefore unknown.}
\label{tab:ece_summary}
\end{table}

\ifnum\EceEvaluated>0\relax
% Calibration evaluated; no additional note.
\else
\noindent\emph{Note.} Calibration (ECE) was not evaluated in this scenario; calibration compliance is therefore unknown in this whitepaper.

\subsection{Provenance}
The run manifest records the dataset hash, code commit, container image digests, random seeds, and timestamps; key fields are listed in Appendix~E.
