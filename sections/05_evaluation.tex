\section{Evaluation Design}
Splits are time-based or k-fold, with an option for cross-bank holdouts. The decision-threshold policy follows the SAP. Calibration uses reliability diagrams with fixed bin edges. Robustness analysis includes distribution shift tests, label-noise stress scenarios, and threshold perturbations.
