\section{Regulatory Mapping}

\Cref{tab:reg_matrix} reproduces the regulatory mapping used for this synthetic audit run, based on the evidence intake for this whitepaper.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{llp{5cm}p{6cm}}
\toprule
Framework & Citation & Requirement & Control assurance and evidence \\
\midrule
\EUAIAct & Art.~10(3) & Data governance and quality for training, validation and testing data & Dataset quality computed; coverage and missingness thresholds enforced; selection rates and metrics persisted for auditability. Evidence is provided via the provenance manifest and selection-rate summaries. \\
CFPB/\ECOA & 12 CFR 1002 & Evaluate disparate impact and record selection disparities by protected class & Disparity ratios (AIR-equivalent) and approval-rate gaps are computed from selection rates with deterministic uncertainty (Wilson + delta-method) and small-n safeguards. Race comparisons are pairwise vs a configured reference group with Holm--Bonferroni p-value adjustment. Evidence is provided via metrics tables and the provenance manifest for this run. \\
