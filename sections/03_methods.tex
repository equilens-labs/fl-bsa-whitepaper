\subsection{Data Scope}
We work with aggregated data only. For each split we use selection counts and rates, per-group confusion counts, and calibration-bin summaries. No row-level data is required for the analyses in this whitepaper.

\subsection{Estimators and Uncertainty}
Proportions use Wilson 95\% confidence intervals \citep{brown2001interval}. Unless otherwise stated, AIR (\cref{eq:air}), equalised-odds gaps (\cref{eq:eo-gap}), and ECE (\cref{eq:ece}) use a BCa bootstrap with $B=\InferenceReplicates{}$ replicates at level $\InferenceAlpha$, following standard bootstrap practice \citep{efron1994bootstrap}. When smoothing is enabled in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), probabilities at 0 or 1 are clipped slightly before resampling to avoid degenerate intervals.

\subsection{Multiplicity Adjustment}
We control the false discovery rate using the Benjamini--Hochberg procedure \citep{benjamini1995fdr}, with target level $q=0.10$, across the family of metrics and slices included in this audit.
