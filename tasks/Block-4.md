Love the plan—and yes, we can absolutely write/design the LaTeX paper now with partial results, while keeping it publication‑ready for your site and arXiv. I’ve already built you a clean LaTeX project (with CI) that compiles today, shows elegant placeholders where results are missing, and auto‑populates tables once metrics arrive.

⸻

What I delivered (ready to use)
	•	LaTeX whitepaper project (publication‑ready; arXiv‑friendly)
	•	Download: latex_whitepaper_skeleton_v1.zip

Highlights
	•	Elegant & rigorous article layout (AMS math, booktabs, microtype, natbib).
	•	Safe for arXiv: no shell‑escape, no custom fonts, no minted; defaults to Computer Modern.
	•	Works with partial results: compiles even if metrics are missing; “TBD” markers appear in the right places.
	•	Auto‑population: a small Python helper converts intake/metrics_long.csv + config/sap.yaml into TeX macros and tables used in the paper.
	•	CI workflow: builds the PDF and an arXiv source zip on each push/PR.

Project structure (curated)

main.tex                  % top-level file
sections/                 % logical sections (exec summary, estimands, methods, results, ...)
includes/
  macros.tex              % global macros, thresholds (defaults)
  metrics_macros.tex      % auto-generated (safe placeholder if absent)
  table_air_summary.tex   % auto-generated from metrics
  table_eo_summary.tex    % auto-generated from metrics
  table_ece_summary.tex   % auto-generated from metrics
scripts/
  gen_tex_macros_from_metrics.py  % reads intake/metrics_long.csv + config/sap.yaml -> includes/*.tex
  arxiv_pack.sh                   % packages arXiv source
bib/references.bib        % natbib (arXiv-friendly)
.github/workflows/latex.yml % CI: build PDF + arXiv source
Makefile                  % make pdf | make arxiv | make clean


⸻

How partial results appear
	•	The paper compiles immediately. If intake/metrics_long.csv isn’t there yet, the Executive Summary shows TBD where numbers go.
	•	Once you add any metrics (even AIR only), run the generator; the summary updates with min AIR, #EO gap violations, max ECE, and the tables fill in.

Command (local or CI):

python3 scripts/gen_tex_macros_from_metrics.py \
  --metrics intake/metrics_long.csv \
  --sap config/sap.yaml \
  --outdir includes

This writes:
	•	includes/metrics_macros.tex — macros like \MinAIR, \NumAIRViolations, thresholds, etc.
	•	includes/table_air_summary.tex, includes/table_eo_summary.tex, includes/table_ece_summary.tex — ready-to-\input{} tables using booktabs.

⸻

CI / deployment workflow (already wired)
	•	GitHub Actions workflow: .github/workflows/latex.yml
It:
	1.	(Optionally) generates macros from intake/metrics_long.csv + config/sap.yaml
	2.	Compiles LaTeX with latexmk → PDF artifact (main.pdf)
	3.	Packages arXiv source → dist/whitepaper_arxiv_source.zip

Local build

# Generate macros (tolerant if intake/ missing):
python3 scripts/gen_tex_macros_from_metrics.py --metrics intake/metrics_long.csv --sap config/sap.yaml --outdir includes || true

# PDF build:
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
# or
make pdf

# ArXiv source package (includes .bbl for safety):
make arxiv


⸻

Writing style and structure (what the paper already contains)
	•	Executive Summary — purpose, thresholds, and a live metric snapshot (\MinAIR, \MaxECE, EO violations).
	•	Problem & Estimands — formal definitions (AIR, EO, ECE) with equations.
	•	Methods — estimators, uncertainty (Wilson CIs, bootstrap), multiplicity.
	•	Model & Algorithm — objective + constraints (EO/DP placeholders), succinct equation block.
	•	Evaluation Design — splits, calibration, robustness.
	•	Results — tables auto-\input{} from includes/table_*.tex.
	•	Compliance, Security/Privacy, Reproducibility, Limitations — concise, regulator‑oriented sections.
	•	Appendices — SAP summary and quick metric definitions.

The tone is neutral, precise, and evidence‑forward—no marketing fluff; equations and references are clean and publishable.

⸻

For arXiv (specifics)
	•	Uses natbib + BibTeX (not biblatex), which arXiv handles well.
	•	No shell‑escape or uncommon packages.
	•	make arxiv produces a source zip with .bbl included for smoother arXiv ingestion.

⸻

What you can do right now
	1.	Commit this project into the whitepaper repo.
	2.	If you have partial metrics, drop them in intake/metrics_long.csv and run the generator (locally or in CI).
	3.	Update config/sap.yaml to your final thresholds.
	4.	Push — CI will publish the PDF and arXiv source artifacts.

⸻

Optional polishing (I can add on request)
	•	A custom title page + institutional footer for your website version.
	•	Automatic figure generation (reliability diagrams) via a safe Python → PDF pipeline included under figures/.
	•	A PR checklist that ensures intake/ and provenance/ are present before a “Release” tag.
	•	Two‑column layout variant for conference submission.

⸻

If this fits, I’ll also wire a “Release” workflow that attaches the compiled PDF + arXiv zip to a GitHub Release. ￼
