Below is a rigorous audit of the Gold Gate artifact bundle you provided.

⸻

1) Context & Goal

You asked for a full, production‑grade review of the artifacts produced by a Gold Gate run, to determine whether they:
(a) prove the product is production-ready, and
(b) satisfy regulatory, safety, and cryptographic integrity requirements.

Scope: Only the files contained in /mnt/data/20251006T151018Z.zip (6.13 MB; 88 entries). I did not assume any external context beyond the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) you gave me and the artifacts inside the zip. No asynchronous work; everything was executed now.

A summarised, portable version of the findings has been generated for your records:

2) Current State & SSoT (what I found)

Bundle structure (top‑level)

20251006T151018Z/
  summary.json
  01_balanced/
  02_gender_bias/
  03_outliers/
  04_security/
  05_evidence_tamper/  ← contains full materials
  06_xlsx_parity/      ← contains dataset CSV/XLSX
  __MACOSX/            (metadata)

Scenarios reported in summary.json:
	•	balanced → pass
	•	gender_bias → fail (band check)
	•	outliers → pass
	•	security → pass
	•	evidence_tamper → pass (scenario validations)
	•	xlsx_parity → fail (decode error)

Important completeness note: Only 05_evidence_tamper/ contains full, verifiable artifacts (metrics, certificates, report, evidence bundles). For 01/02/03/04, directories exist but are effectively empty in this zip; I relied on summary.json for their outcomes and validations.

SSoT expectations used in review (from your configuration brief):
	•	Certification chain and hashing rules (flbsa/certification/*),
	•	Validation/QC (flbsa/validation/qc_validator.py),
	•	Metrics (flbsa/metrics/*),
	•	Orchestrator tasks & evidence packaging (flbsa/orchestrator/tasks/*),
	•	Docs for quality gates & security configs.

⸻

3) Proposed Approach (what I did)
	1.	Artifact integrity pass
	•	Enumerated all files; computed SHA‑256 for key artifacts.
	•	Verified encryption flags and magic headers (ZIP vs ENC).
	•	Read summary.json to align scenario statuses and validations.
	2.	Cryptographic chain-of-custody
	•	Opened certificates in 05_evidence_tamper/ and validated the reported chain (previous→current hashes, presence of ECDSA signatures, fingerprint IDs).
	•	Compared reported chain validations in summary.json with on‑disk artifacts.
	3.	Regulatory compliance assertions
	•	Inspected 05_evidence_tamper/metrics.json for:
	•	DI/AOD/EOD, dataset‑quality violations, and regulatory_mapping summary (ECOA/Reg B, EU AI Act, FCA).
	•	Compared reported PDF anchors & numeric parity checks with metrics.
	4.	Packaging & reproducibility checks
	•	Confirmed presence of generator pickle and seed in metrics.json.
	•	Checked for secrets/PII leakage in text artifacts (none found).
	•	Examined the XLSX parity scenario packaging defect.

⸻

4) Findings & Change‑Set Preview

A. Executive verdict

Not production‑ready yet. There are two scenario failures, one compliance‑status fail inside the metrics of a “passing” scenario, and incomplete per‑scenario evidence packaging. The cryptographic and evidence‑packaging controls are otherwise solid.

⸻

B. Pass/Fail summary (from summary.json)

Scenario	Status	Key validations observed
balanced	PASS	metrics schema ✔︎, bands ✔︎, PDF anchors ✔︎, numeric parity ✔︎, cert chain ✔︎, signatures ✔︎, encryption ✔︎
gender_bias	FAIL	metrics schema ✔︎, bands ✖︎ (di=0.7035 outside [0.6, 0.7]), PDF anchors ✔︎, numeric parity ✔︎, cert chain ✔︎, signatures ✔︎, encryption ✔︎
outliers	PASS	(per summary)
security	PASS	(per summary; includes chain & signatures checks)
evidence_tamper	PASS (scenario)	metrics schema ✔︎, PDF anchors ✔︎, numeric parity ✔︎, cert chain ✔︎, signatures ✔︎, enc ✔︎, tamper chain ✔︎
xlsx_parity	FAIL	pipeline aborted (UTF‑8 decode error)

C. Detailed issues (blocking vs non‑blocking)

1) Gold Gate logical miss: compliance FAIL not propagated
	•	In 05_evidence_tamper/metrics.json →
	•	summary.overall_status = "FAIL" due to dataset‑quality violation (split_drift_pp = 46.36 vs threshold 2.0) and multiple regulatory warnings.
	•	Mapping shows ECOA/Reg B = PASS, EU AI Act = WARNING, FCA Consumer Duty = WARNING; still, overall_status = FAIL.
	•	Yet the scenario is marked pass in summary.json.
	•	Impact: High — The gate currently green‑lights a run where the compliance summary is FAIL.
	•	Lanes: Validation aggregator / quality gates.
	•	Change (policy/no‑code): Gold Gate must fail if any scenario’s metrics.json.summary.overall_status == "FAIL". Warnings may be tolerated per policy; FAIL must block.
	•	Rollback: Pure config/policy; revert to current aggregator if necessary.

2) gender_bias scenario failed: band check too tight or nondeterminism
	•	Failure: metrics_bands: di=0.7035 outside [0.6, 0.7].
	•	All other validations (PDF anchors, numeric parity, chain, signatures, encryption) passed.
	•	Interpretation: The band is a test harness tolerance (not a regulatory threshold). Being 0.0035 above the upper band suggests minor stochastic variance.
	•	Impact: Medium — Failing the gate for such a small drift reduces operational reliability.
	•	Lanes: Metrics harness; determinism guardrails.
	•	Change:
	•	(a) Tighten determinism: clamp OPENBLAS/MKL/OMP/NUMEXPR=1 and Torch threads; force deterministic algorithms for CTGAN (Torch) in the Gold lane; propagate a fixed RNG seed and document it in the certificate.
	•	(b) Adjust the band rule to target ±0.01 absolute or percent‑tolerance derived from expected DI for this fixture (still strict, not lax).
	•	Rollback: Restore previous band rule if needed.

3) xlsx_parity packaging defect (causes pipeline failure)
	•	06_xlsx_parity/dataset.csv is not CSV; it is byte‑for‑byte identical to the XLSX file (ZIP magic 504b0304).
	•	SHA‑256 dataset.csv = d85000a5… equals dataset/xlsx_parity.xlsx; real CSV is at dataset/xlsx_parity.csv.
	•	This explains the run error: UTF‑8 decode failed on a binary XLSX.
	•	Impact: High — Scenario fails; parity between CSV/XLSX cannot be validated.
	•	Lanes: Packaging / exporter; scenario data preparation.
	•	Change: Fix the packer to place the binary XLSX only at .xlsx, and the text CSV only at .csv. Add a preflight that rejects ZIP‑magic in any *.csv.
	•	Rollback: None needed beyond reverting the packer change.

4) Evidence completeness gap across scenarios
	•	Only 05_evidence_tamper/ contains full artifacts (certs, report, metrics).
	•	01/02/03/04 directories in this zip are empty; review relies on summary.json only.
	•	Impact: High — Auditors need per‑scenario bundles (reports, metrics, certs) for reproducibility and evidence trails.
	•	Lanes: Orchestrator packaging; archive assembly.
	•	Change: Ensure each scenario exports a self‑contained evidence bundle (bundle.zip + .zip.enc) including certs, metrics, PDF, AAN reasons, generator, and report metadata.
	•	Rollback: Revert packaging recipe.

5) Metrics API manifest unavailable (in 05_evidence_tamper/metrics_api.json)
	•	status = "unavailable", partial = true, errors = [{"reason": "missing_manifest"}].
	•	Impact: Medium — Production should expose a consistent metrics_api.json or omit it.
	•	Lanes: API integration / manifest writer.
	•	Change: Always write the manifest or gate on status == "available" for Gold; otherwise, omit this artifact.

6) Certificate hashing reproducibility not externally verifiable
	•	The chain reported in validations is internally consistent (previous→current hashes match). Signatures are present (ECDSA-P256-SHA256, fingerprint 1b0979182daa45af), but without the hasher spec and public key material, I cannot deterministically recompute certificate_hash byte‑for‑byte.
	•	Impact: Medium — For external audits, provide the hashing procedure (canonical JSON rules, float precision) and verification keys.
	•	Lanes: Certification hasher; Trust Center.
	•	Change: Ship certification/hasher_spec.md, public verification key(s), and a CLI verifier; include a mini test vector set.

7) Minor: internal absolute path exposure
	•	report_metadata.json includes container path /app/output/....
	•	Impact: Low — Not PII, but avoid leaking internal paths.
	•	Lanes: Packaging.
	•	Change: Store relative paths or redact path fields in export.

⸻

D. Positive controls verified (good signals)
	•	Evidence encryption: AES‑256‑GCM; .enc file is not ZIP; manifest SHA‑256 matches computed (297e22b2…).
	•	Certificate chain: Hyperparameter Tuning → Model (amp/intrinsic) → Generation Process → Synthetic Validation; links consistent; signatures present.
	•	PDF report parity: Report anchors found; numeric parity deltas within 1e‑3 to 1e‑4 vs metrics; tolerance 0.01.
	•	Adverse Action Reasons: Present with codes (e.g., AA.CAPACITY.DTI_HIGH, AA.HISTORY.LIMITED), meeting ECOA/CFPB documentation expectations.
	•	No secret leakage: No API keys, passwords, or private keys found in text artifacts.

E. Change‑Set Preview (surgical, narrow diffs)

Note: Paths reference SSoT locations you provided. If any differ in your repo, I’ll adapt.

	1.	Gold Gate aggregator — treat compliance FAIL as gate FAIL
	•	Lane: flbsa/validation/qc_validator.py (or the Gold aggregator module)
	•	Diff (policy logic):

# Pseudocode: after collecting per-scenario validations
for scenario in scenarios:
    metrics_path = scenario_dir / "metrics.json"
    if metrics_path.exists():
        m = json.load(open(metrics_path))
        overall = m.get("summary", {}).get("overall_status")
        if overall == "FAIL":
            scenario["status"] = "fail_compliance"
gate_pass = all(s["status"].startswith("pass") for s in scenarios)

	•	Impact: High (prevents false greens).
	•	Rollback: Remove the extra check.

	2.	Tighten determinism & band rule for gender_bias
	•	Lane: metrics harness; test configuration; CTGAN determinism.
	•	Diff (policy):
	•	Enforce OPENBLAS/MKL/OMP/NUMEXPR=1 and Torch deterministic mode for Gold.
	•	Change band check to absolute tolerance: abs(di - expected_di) <= 0.01.
	•	Impact: Medium.
	•	Rollback: restore old band limits.
	3.	CSV/XLSX packaging preflight
	•	Lane: flbsa/orchestrator/tasks/* packer.
	•	Diff (logic):

def assert_plaintext_csv(path: Path) -> None:
    magic = path.read_bytes()[:4]
    if magic == b"PK\x03\x04":
        raise ValueError(f"CSV appears to be a ZIP/XLSX: {path}")

	•	Ensure the real CSV is exported as *.csv, XLSX as *.xlsx.
	•	Impact: High (fixes scenario).
	•	Rollback: none.

	4.	Artifact completeness per scenario
	•	Lane: packaging.
	•	Diff (policy): Require bundling per‑scenario bundle.zip + .zip.enc, including: report.pdf, metrics.json, metrics_api.json (if used), all certificates, generator_*.pkl, adverse_action_reasons.json, and report_metadata.json.
	•	Impact: High.
	•	Rollback: allow missing pieces (not recommended).
	5.	Hasher verification kit
	•	Lane: flbsa/certification/*.
	•	Deliverables: hasher_spec.md; verify_certificate.py (CLI), public verification keys; add a regression test vector.
	•	Impact: Medium.
	•	Rollback: docs‑only revert.

⸻

5) Verification Plan (deterministic, auditable)

Inputs: the same ZIP bundle path.
	1.	Gate decision correctness
	•	Criterion: The Gold Gate should be RED if any scenario’s metrics.json.summary.overall_status == "FAIL".
	•	Method: Inspect each scenario’s metrics.json; assert no "FAIL". For this bundle, 05_evidence_tamper currently contains "FAIL" → gate must be RED.
	2.	Scenario results
	•	Criterion: All required scenarios report "status": "pass" and provide complete evidence bundles.
	•	Method: For each scenario directory: presence of {report.pdf, metrics.json, certificates/*, generator_*.pkl, adverse_action_reasons.json, report_metadata.json} and (optionally) the encrypted bundle.
	3.	Cryptographic controls
	•	Criterion: Evidence bundle encryption AES‑256‑GCM; .enc not ZIP; SHA‑256 computed equals manifest.
	•	Method: Compute SHA‑256 of evidence.zip → 297e22b2…; compare to validation manifest (match). Check header of .enc ≠ ZIP magic (OK).
	4.	Certificate chain
	•	Criterion: All previous_certificate_hash values match the certificate_hash of the prior artifact; signatures present and verify with published keys.
	•	Method: Already consistent in 05_evidence_tamper. For a full re‑run, include public keys + external verifier.
	5.	PDF parity
	•	Criterion: pdf_numeric_parity within ≤ 0.01 across DI/AOD/EOD; anchors present.
	•	Method: Already satisfied per summary.json for passing scenarios.
	6.	XLSX/CSV parity
	•	Criterion: Parity pipeline must complete; no binary XLSX placed in .csv.
	•	Method: Preflight guard + re‑run; the CSV loader should accept dataset.csv as plain text.

⸻

6) Risk & Rollback
	•	Risks addressed: False positive pass due to aggregator oversight; reproducibility drift; packaging instability.
	•	Rollback: All proposed changes are surgical and reversible (policy toggles or small packer checks). No schema or API breaks proposed.

⸻

7) Follow‑ups
	•	Add a Gold Gate policy section to docs/development/quality-gates.md: explicitly state that metrics overall_status = FAIL blocks the gate, with examples.
	•	In docs/security/Security_Configuration_Guide.md, add the CSV/XLSX preflight rule and determinism environment table for Gold runs.
	•	Update the test classification table (docs/testing/test-classification.md) with the adjusted band rule and determinism settings for gender_bias.
	•	Publish hasher spec + public keys in the Trust Center; include a link/reference in the evidence bundle.

⸻

8) Assumptions & Unknowns
	•	Hasher details (canonical JSON formatting, float precision) and public verification keys are not included in the bundle. I verified the chain logically but did not re‑derive the exact certificate_hash values without the official hasher spec.
	•	For scenarios 01/02/03/04, the zip lacks full per‑scenario artifacts; I used summary.json for their results. If full bundles exist elsewhere, please provide them for a complete audit.
	•	Regulatory thresholds (e.g., EU AI Act % tolerance, FCA deviation bands) appear to be encoded in metrics.json logic for 05_evidence_tamper; I used those as the source of truth and did not substitute external thresholds.

⸻

Bottom line
	•	Cryptography & packaging: strong (encryption, chain, signatures, PDF parity all good).
	•	Operational & compliance gating: needs correction — a compliance FAIL must flip the gate to FAIL; fix XLSX parity packaging; widen or stabilize the gender_bias tolerance to avoid spurious reds.
	•	Evidence completeness: Expand per‑scenario bundles in the export to make the Gold Gate audit fully self-contained.

If you share the missing scenario bundles and the hasher spec/public keys, I can run the same deterministic checks on those immediately and update the verdict. ￼
