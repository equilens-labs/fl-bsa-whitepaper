\section{Evaluation Design}
This whitepaper evaluates three data slices produced by the Gate-WP evidence pipeline: (i) the historical baseline (input dataset), (ii) the bias-preserving amplification synthetic slice, and (iii) the de-biased intrinsic synthetic slice (with deterministic post-labelling when enabled). We report selection-rate fairness (disparity ratios and approval-rate gaps) using aggregated counts with deterministic uncertainty. Calibration requires probability scores and calibration bins and is not evaluated in this scenario.
