\section{Model Hyperparameters (CTGAN)}
This appendix summarises the chosen hyperparameters for the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) models used in this synthetic audit scenario. Values are derived directly from the hyperparameter configuration in the intake bundle for this run.
