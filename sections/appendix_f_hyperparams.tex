\section{Model Hyperparameters (CTGAN)}
This appendix summarises the chosen hyperparameters for the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) models used in this synthetic audit scenario. Values are derived from the model certificates in the intake bundle for this run (preferred), with a fallback to the local intake hyperparameter template when certificates are not available.
