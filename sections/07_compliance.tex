\section{Compliance Mapping}
We map framework requirements (\emph{e.g.}\ \ECOA/\RegB, SR 11-7, \EUAIAct) to controls and evidence artefacts. The detailed mapping for this run is given in Appendix~D. Model risk management expectations under SR 11-7 \citep{sr11_7} are addressed via documented model purpose, limitations, monitoring, and the provenance and evidence chain described in this paper.
