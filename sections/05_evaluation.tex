\section{Evaluation Design}
This whitepaper evaluates the synthetic audit \emph{test} split produced by the Gate-WP evidence pipeline. We report selection-rate fairness (disparity ratios and approval-rate gaps) using aggregated counts with deterministic uncertainty. Calibration requires probability scores and calibration bins and is not evaluated in this scenario.
